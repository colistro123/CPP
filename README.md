CPP
===

You can find most of my C++ projects here

Includes:
===
- Things I've done for Nightfire Source (A valve modification running on the Half Life engine)
- Personal projects that were done for experimental purposes.
- A file that contains a very little permission based system. (Bitwise operators and others)
